Compile flags:
DEBUG	Enables AI debug mode and plays one AI vs Ai game in the beginning.

colour	changes fg colour to magenta. (requested feature)

audio	Enables Audio class, plays doom soundtrack in the background
		and random Unreal Tornament announcer tracks on victory, defeat
		and end of the game.

		Due to mono's audio issues, Audio class uses unix mpv media player
		for playback. Untested on windows.
		Paths to player can be OS/distro
		specific.
